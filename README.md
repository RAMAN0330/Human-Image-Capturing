# Human-Image-Capturing
Here we are Using OpenCv for image Recogination and identifying Human Face Using haarcascades frontal face model.

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today’s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human. When it integrated with various libraries, such as NumPy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis. To Identify image pattern and its various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on these features. 

Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier. 
Types of Images: 
      Positive images – These images contain the images which we want our classifier to identify.
      Negative Images – Images of everything else, which do not contain the object we want to detect.
Requirements: 
      Make sure you have python, Matplotlib and OpenCV installed on your pc (all the latest versions).

Haar Cascades can be used to detect any types of objects as long as you have the appropriate XML file for it. 
You can even create your own XML files from scratch to detect whatever type of object you want.
